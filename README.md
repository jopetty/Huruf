# Huruf (حروف)
A simple chrome extension to make reading Arabic easier

## Features
Huruf makes reading on-screen Arabic easier by increasing the font size of all characters within the the unicode ranges of the Arabic script; this means that Huruf will work on any language that uses the Arabic script, not just Arabic (e.g. Persian, Punjabi, Urdu, etc). You can set the font size and line height to be up to 150% of the default value.

Huruf also sets the font of Arabic characters to ```Droid Arabic Naskh```, an easier-to-read font than many default Arabic script fonts.
